<div class="pad">
<p>This project had too many aspects to work on, the android programing one was the easiest part, since it only had to set three variables and when a two of them have the same value it had to just send a Bluetooth signal to the microcontroller that is connected to the really to close the current or open it.</p>
<p>The ESP32 microcontroller programing was easy too because it was a simple C program to receive binary Bluetooth signal and to send a 0 or 1 signal to one of the ports.</p>
<p>The major problem was the electricity connection since I had no idea how to work at it safely, the original plan was to work on the 240 V that is inside the wall, but I have convinced the supervisor to change it to the charger that only have 5V because if a problem was to occur, it is easier to deal with it rather than the 240V that is inside the wall <span>&#40;</span>I could easily shut down the building’s electricity or be electrocuted if I done any error and I am an amateur in electricity<span>&#41;</span>.</p>
<p>At the end I had done it and I had a working, intelligent charger, but unfortunately in the end it wasn’t a as fast as the original charger and there were a lot of questions in my mind about its safety.</p>
