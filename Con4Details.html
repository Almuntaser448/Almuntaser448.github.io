    <p>Since it was my first real program in python I had some issues because of the python principles and that made me lose valuable time, so at the end, I had the time to only use three algorithms and I didn’t really optimize the MCTS algorithm with a strategy for the game which made this algorithm take a valuable time to finish since I have developed it just after watching a video on YouTube that explains it.</p>
    <p>One of my problem was the difference between the copy and the deepcopy functions and because of that at the first two to three weeks of the development I didn’t have a working game with the min, max algorithm even though I made sure that all my code normally works, I have found the deep copy problem in the night before the deadline of the project and fortunately my code was really working as intended once I changed the copy function to deepcopy.</p>
    <p>But thanks to this project I had fun when I found the error and was able to play my first game that I have programmed myself with the help of another student, it also made me sure that I wanted to continue my studies in a field like this where I need to search for ways to make the computer does what I want to do.</p>
