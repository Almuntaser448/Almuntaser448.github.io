    <p>This is my personal project and since it is personal it is the only one in my mother language <span>&#40;</span> Arabic <span>&#41;</span>.</p>
        <p>I had the idea when I heard about the chatbot apps and how the kids or even the grand public love to speak with them or write with them.</p>
        <p>I have also watched a lot of youtubers making videos speaking with chatbots, and I was also aware that the students don’t love to learn the history because it is boring and it is about the dead.</p>
        <p>So, I had the crazy idea of making those students who love talking with Alexa to talk with the historical figures.</p>
        <p>I have done my research and I found about Dialog flow and how the chatbot works with all the NLP in the back-end.</p>
        <p>I tried to develop an application that must work on the android, iPhone, and the web, easy to use, and can be used as chatbot interface that make the chat looks real like WhatsApp.</p>
        <p>To do that I have learned Flutter via the documentation and the online community, and I was able to do what I wanted even though the design on the web wasn’t good it was just like if I had a phone with a big screen.</p>
        <p>Then I tried some tests with one of the historical figures in Dialogflow after that I have installed the application on my phone to see if I can chat with the historical figures and that if I had the same information that I have written in Dialogflow, which I had fortunately.</p>
        <p>But I found that to finish this project I had to write millions of words on Dialogflow, otherwise the program won’t be functional, and it will be just like a book nothing like a real chatbot. </p>
        <p>Another problem that I had is that I wanted to make the chat more realistic, so I wanted to add battle sounds when there is talk about the battles, and other sounds when the time is right.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, neither Flutter nor React have the thread function so I had to either restart the whole program or deny a big opportunity to make the program the way that I saw it in my head, so I decided to restart from the beginning and program the android version in java and see how it works.</p>
        <p>I also found that If I was able to study the machine learning I can understand better how the chatbots and the NLP works, and I may be able to solve the problem by writing millions of words in Dialogflow.</p>
        <p>It may also make my document analysis better since it had the text mining so that I may be able to create a program that extract the data for a historical figure from a book.</p>
