    <h3 class="text-center">Of course, the world isn’t just about projects and learning, in this page I will talk about my hobbies and give you some recommendation if you are bored and you want to watch something</h3>
<h4 class="text-center">sports</h4>
<div class="pad">
<img class="hobim" src="img/sport.jpg" alt="a free rights photo of sports">
<p>Unfortunately, because of my medical conditions <span>&#40;</span> I have asthma and mitral valve prolapse so fortunately it is nothing serious, but I am forbidden from making a physical effort without relaxing every now and then<span>&#41;</span> the only sports that I can practice are cycling, jogging, and swimming. Out of the three swimming is my best sport, I especially love to dive and swim underwater.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="text-center">tv series </h4>

<div class="pad">
    <img class="hobim"  src="img/series.jpg" alt="a free rights photo of series">
<p>As for the series I have watched a lot of series and my best one is Breaking Bad since it is almost the only series with a good ending. Unlike the game of thrones for example, which had a terrible ending.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="text-center"> Asian pop culture </h4>
<div class="pad">
    <img class="hobim" src="img/japan.jpg" alt="a photo of an event of anime in japan">
<p>I also watch Asian pop culture and attend events related to it</p>
<p>If you are new to the anime and you want to watch a good Japanese anime I advise you to watch Death Note, and if you have already watched a lot of animes then I advise you to watch Gintama.</p>
<p>If you want to read Korean Manha then I recommend you read Solo leveling a very good Manha with a good ending.</p>
<p>If you want to read Chines Manhwa then I recommend to you Apotheosis, it has a lot of chapters, but it is a very good one.</p></div>
