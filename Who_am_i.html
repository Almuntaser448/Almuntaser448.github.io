    <h2>My name is Almuntaser Bashiti I am 23 years old and i love developing crazy things.</h2>
</div>
<div class="textInfoPers">
    <p>I speak three languages dynamically and I have a License in Computer Since from the university of Paris Cite.</p>
    <p>The first reason why I entered this field is to be able to study AI because one of my dreams is to create something that will help the humanity and be a part of the people who develop the future rather than just waiting for the future to be developed to me.</p>
    <p>The other is that I want to be able to work on different things rather than doing the same thing all my life.</p>
    <p>In my life I had too many different ideas that I want to work on but I lack the capacity to do it.</p>
    <p>One of those ideas is the Chat Bot for education, I mean that we all know how the students don<span>&#44;</span>t really love history because it is old for them, and we all know how the students or love new technology, especially the domain of AI and the chat bots, so I had this idea to mix the old with the new and create a chatbot that impersonate the historical figures.</p>
    <p>Luckily I was able to create a beta version of this idea using flutter and Dialogflow but there was a problem.</p> 
    <p>I don<span>&#44;</span>t really know who exactly does the NLP and NLG works so in order to make my chatbot impersonate a historical figure I had to manually type all the data and all of the different ways to ask questions into my database in Dialogflow , that is why I wanted to learn the AI in order to have a solution for this problem or at least creating an intelligent application that identifies what the historical figure have done from a book and give me what it found in order to make my work easier.</p>
    <p>Another reason for me to learn the AI is to find other ways to help solve a problem, because I didn<span>&#44;</span>t have the idea of the chatbot that impersonate a historical figure before that I found about Dialogflow, so I am excited to learn about new things to have new ideas to work on in my personal time.</p>
    <p>Other than this passion I have skills in programing, and you can find some of my released projects with details on this page.</p>
    <p>As you can see I unfortunately lack a sense of a proper design</p>
